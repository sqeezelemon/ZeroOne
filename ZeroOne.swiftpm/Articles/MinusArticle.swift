But to actually invert a binary integer, we need a bit more - get it's two's compliment, done in 2 steps:
`1. `Invert all bits (0 becomes 1 and vice versa)
`2. `Add 1
The resulting binary integer is called two's compliment and is all you need to change the sign of a binary integer. You can try calculating it yourself or get it calculated automatically bellow:

But how do we actually subtract once we have the two's compliment? Well, we just add up the numbers. Something to keep in mind is the use of overflow: there are still situations where it could be problematic (minimum minus one would give us the maximum), yet it also helps us when adding up anything negative related.
